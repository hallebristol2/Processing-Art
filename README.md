# Processing-Art
Pictures of the code output are included in each folder.

These projects were created in 2017 in high school for the Intro to Computer Art & Design course using Processing (Java).
Led by Matthew Harbinger, the course taught the intersection between art and programming. These files can be downloaded and imported
to Processing, and were created under version 3.
